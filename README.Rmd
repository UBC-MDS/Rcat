# Rcat

<!-- badges: start -->

### Project Overview
`Rcat` provides a set of convenient functions for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). In the early stage of the data science projects, EDA is a critical stage to perform an initial investigation on the dataset and inspire valuable research questions. This packages simplifies the process of detecting and dealing with missing and suspicious values in the dataset, as well as finding the relevant features.

### Functions
The following 4 functions are included in our package.

1. `misscat`: This function provides a summary of missing values in the data frame and drops rows or columns if the number of the missing values exceeds the input threshold.

2. `suscat`: Data frames could include erroneous values such as outliers. This function detects suspected erroneous numeric data in user chosen columns.

3. `repwithna`: Data frames sometimes include uninformative strings such as strings with only punctuations, or blank strings, which could be noises for the later analysis. This function replaces these strings with `NA` so they can be removed as missing values.
        
4. `topcorr`: This function generates a list of top-correlated features in the data frame.

### How `Rcat` fit in the R ecosystem
There are several existing packages in R that implement similar functionality. 
- [SmartEDA](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SmartEDA/index.html)  
This package generates descriptive statistics and visualisations for data frames. A HTML EDA report is also avaliable.
- [DataExplorer](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SmartEDA/index.html)  
This package can analyze and visualize each variable in a data frame. It also includes common data processing methods for wrangling.
- [inspectdf](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/inspectdf/index.html)  
This package offers columnwise summary, comparison and visualisation of data frames.


## Installation

You can install the released version of Rcat from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:
